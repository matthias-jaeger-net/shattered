# shattered

Shattered is a series of graphics created with the help of the p5.js library and the matter.js library. 
The program creates a grid of Cell objects. For each Cell physics are calculated and they bounce nicly down the screen. 
In the p5 sketch, which creates a html 5 canvas, a pixel graphic is rendered, while also (at the same time an svg string variable 
rendering the same result as seeen on the screen is created). After 100 frames, which I consider a lot of time to get results,
the file is handed to the user as a download.
